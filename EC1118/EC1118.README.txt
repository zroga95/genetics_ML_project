Preliminary Release of S. cerevisiae strain EC1118 sequences.

7/8/2011

This directory contains 4 files describing the genome of S. cerevisiae strain
EC1118 (Accession: PRJEA37863). The files are:

a genome fasta file: EC1118_Genoscope_2009_PRJEA37863.fsa
a nucleic acid coding sequence file: EC1118_PRJEA37863_cds.fsa
a protein sequence file: EC1118_PRJEA37863_pep.fsa
a GFF file: EC1118_PRJEA37863.gff

Feature definitions (for coding sequences and features in the gff file) were
assigned using Jim Kent's liftOver program with a blat alignment vs. the R64
(current) S288C reference sequence.

This assembly contains 31 contigs (mean contig size: 376113, N50: 776014).
Using liftOver, 6352 SGD gene features were found in the assembly.
