Preliminary Release of S. cerevisiae strain Fosters O sequences.

4/29/2011

This directory contains 4 files describing the genome of S. cerevisiae strain
Fosters O (PMID: 21304888; WGS ID: AEEZ00000000). The files are:

a genome fasta file: FostersO_AWRI_2010_AEEZ01000000.fsa
a nucleic acid coding sequence file: FostersO_AEEZ01000000_cds.fsa
a protein sequence file: FostersO_AEEZ01000000_pep.fsa
a GFF file: FostersO_AEEZ01000000.gff

Feature definitions (for coding sequences and features in the gff file) were
assigned using Jim Kent's liftOver program with a blat alignment vs. the R64
(current) S288C reference sequence.

This assembly contains 222 contigs (coverage: 20X, mean contig size: 52635,
N50: 195316). Using liftOver, 6239 SGD gene features were found
in the assembly.
