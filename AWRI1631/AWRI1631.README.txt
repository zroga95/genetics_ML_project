Preliminary Release of S. cerevisiae strain AWRI1631 sequences.

4/29/2011

This directory contains 4 files describing the genome of S. cerevisiae strain
AWRI1631 (PMID:18778279; WGS ID: ABSV00000000). The files are:

a genome fasta file: AWRI1631_AWRI_2008_ABSV01000000.fsa
a nucleic acid coding sequence file: AWRI1631_ABSV01000000_cds.fsa
a protein sequence file: AWRI1631_ABSV01000000_pep.fsa
a GFF file: AWRI1631_ABSV01000000.gff

Feature definitions (for coding sequences and features in the gff file) were
assigned using Jim Kent's liftOver program with a blat alignment vs. the R64
(current) S288C reference sequence.

This assembly contains 2484 contigs (coverage: 7X, mean contig size: 4500,
N50: 7704). Using liftOver, 4747 SGD gene features were found in
the assembly.
