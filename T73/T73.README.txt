Preliminary Release of S. cerevisiae strain T73 sequences.

4/29/2011

This directory contains 4 files describing the genome of S. cerevisiae strain
T73 (WGS ID: AFDF00000000). The files are:

a genome fasta file: T73_WashU_2011_AFDF01000000.fsa
a nucleic acid coding sequence file: T73_AFDF01000000_cds.fsa
a protein sequence file: T73_AFDF01000000_pep.fsa
a GFF file: T73_AFDF01000000.gff

Feature definitions (for coding sequences and features in the gff file) were
assigned using Jim Kent's liftOver program with a blat alignment vs. the R64
(current) S288C reference sequence.

This assembly contains 5882 contigs (coverage: 13.9X, mean contig size: 1875,
N50: 2945). Using liftOver, 3324 SGD gene features were found in the assembly.
