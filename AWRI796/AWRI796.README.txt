Preliminary Release of S. cerevisiae strain AWRI796 sequences.

4/29/2011

This directory contains 4 files describing the genome of S. cerevisiae strain
AWRI796 (PMID: 21304888; WGS ID: ADVS00000000). The files are:

a genome fasta file: AWRI796_AWRI_2010_ADVS01000000.fsa
a nucleic acid coding sequence file: AWRI796_ADVS01000000_cds.fsa
a protein sequence file: AWRI796_ADVS01000000_pep.fsa
a GFF file: AWRI796_ADVS01000000.gff

Feature definitions (for coding sequences and features in the gff file) were
assigned using Jim Kent's liftOver program with a blat alignment vs. the R64
(current) S288C reference sequence.

This assembly contains 105 contigs (coverage: 20X, mean contig size: 111795,
N50: 403341). Using liftOver, 6295 SGD gene features were found
in the assembly.
