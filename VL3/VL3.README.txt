Preliminary Release of S. cerevisiae strain VL3 sequences.

4/29/2011

This directory contains 4 files describing the genome of S. cerevisiae strain
VL3 (PMID: 21304888, WGS ID: AEJS00000000). The files are:

a genome fasta file: VL3_AWRI_2011_AEJS01000000.fsa
a nucleic acid coding sequence file: VL3_AEJS01000000_cds.fsa
a protein sequence file: VL3_AEJS01000000_pep.fsa
a GFF file: VL3_AEJS01000000.gff

Feature definitions (for coding sequences and features in the gff file) were
assigned using Jim Kent's liftOver program with a blat alignment vs. the R64
(current) S288C reference sequence.

This assembly contains 125 contigs (coverage: 20X, mean contig size: 93257,
N50: 293399). Using liftOver, 6322 SGD gene features were found in the assembly.
