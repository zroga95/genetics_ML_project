Preliminary Release of S. cerevisiae strain Kyokai no. 7 sequence.

10/6/2011

This directory contains 4 files describing the genome of S. cerevisiae strain
Kyokai no. 7 (WGS ID: BABQ00000000). The files are:

a genome fasta file: Kyokai7_NRIB_2011_BABQ01000000.fsa
a nucleic acid coding sequence file: Kyokai7_BABQ01000000_cds.fsa
a protein sequence file: Kyokai7_BABQ01000000_pep.fsa
a GFF file: Kyokai7_BABQ01000000.gff

Feature definitions (for coding sequences and features in the gff file) were
assigned using Jim Kent's liftOver program with a blat alignment vs. the R64
(current) S288C reference sequence.

This assembly contains 705 contigs (coverage: 9.1X, mean contig size: 17547,
N50: 120978). Using liftOver, 6285 SGD gene features were found in the assembly.
