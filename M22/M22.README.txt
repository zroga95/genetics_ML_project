Preliminary Release of S. cerevisiae strain M22 sequences.

4/29/2011

This directory contains 4 files describing the genome of S. cerevisiae strain
M22 (WGS ID: ABPC00000000). The files are:

a genome fasta file: M22WashU_2008_ABPC01000000.fsa
a nucleic acid coding sequence file: M22_cds_ABPC01000000.fsa
a protein sequence file: M22_pep_ABPC01000000.fsa
a GFF file: M22_ABPC01000000.gff

Feature definitions (for coding sequences and features in the gff file) were
assigned using Jim Kent's liftOver program with a blat alignment vs. the R64
(current) S288C reference sequence.

This assembly contains 6145 contigs (coverage: 2X, mean contig size: 1754,
N50: 2207). Using liftOver, 2548 SGD gene features were found in the assembly.
