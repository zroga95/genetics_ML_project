Preliminary Release of S. cerevisiae strain Fosters B sequences.

4/29/2011

This directory contains 4 files describing the genome of S. cerevisiae strain
FostersB (PMID: 21304888; WGS ID: AEHH00000000). The files are:

a genome fasta file: FostersB_AWRI_2010_AEHH01000000.fsa
a nucleic acid coding sequence file: FostersB_AEHH01000000_cds.fsa
a protein sequence file: FostersB_AEHH01000000_pep.fsa
a GFF file: FostersB_AEHH01000000.gff

Feature definitions (for coding sequences and features in the gff file) were
assigned using Jim Kent's LiftOver program with a blat alignment vs. the R64
(current) S288C reference sequence.

This assembly contains 142 contigs (coverage: 20X, mean contig size: 81045,
N50: 204208). Using liftOver, 6240 SGD gene features were found in the assembly.
