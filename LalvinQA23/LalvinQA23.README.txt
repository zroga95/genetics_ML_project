Preliminary Release of S. cerevisiae strain Lalvin QA23 sequences.

4/29/2011

This directory contains 4 files describing the genome of S. cerevisiae strain
Lalvin QA23 (PMID: 21304888; WGS ID: ADVV00000000). The files are:

a genome fasta file: LalvinQA23_AWRI_2011_ADVV01000000.fsa
a nucleic acid coding sequence file: LalvinQA23_ADVV01000000_cds.fsa
a protein sequence file: LalvinQA23_ADVV01000000_pep.fsa
a GFF file: LalvinQA23_ADVV01000000.gff

Feature definitions (for coding sequences and features in the gff file) were
assigned using Jim Kent's liftOver program with a blat alignment vs. the R64
(current) S288C reference sequence.

This assembly contains 185 contigs (coverage: 20X, mean contig size: 63806,
N50: 182942). Using liftOver, 6293 SGD gene features were found in the assembly.
