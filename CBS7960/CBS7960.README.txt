Preliminary Release of S. cerevisiae strain CBS7960 sequences.

4/29/2011

This directory contains 4 files describing the genome of S. cerevisiae strain
CBS7960 (WGS ID: AEWL00000000). The files are:

a genome fasta file: CBS7960_WashU_2011_AEWL01000000.fsa
a nucleic acid coding sequence file: CBS7960_AEWL01000000_cds.fsa
a protein sequence file: CBS7960_AEWL01000000_pep.fsa
a GFF file: CBS7960_AEWL01000000.gff

Feature definitions (for coding sequences and features in the gff file) were
assigned using Jim Kent's liftOver program with a blat alignment vs. the R64
(current) S288C reference sequence.

This assembly contains 2367 contigs (coverage: 17X, mean contig size: 5161,
N50:18761). Using liftOver, 5333 SGD gene features were found in the assembly.
