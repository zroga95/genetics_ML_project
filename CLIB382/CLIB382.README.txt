Preliminary Release of S. cerevisiae strain CLIB382 sequences.

4/29/2011

This directory contains 4 files describing the genome of S. cerevisiae strain
CLIB382 (WGS ID: AFDG00000000). The files are:

a genome fasta file: CLIB382_WashU_2011_AFDG01000000.fsa
a nucleic acid coding sequence file: CLIB382_AFDG01000000_cds.fsa
a protein sequence file: CLIB382_AFDG01000000_pep.fsa
a GFF file: CLIB382_AFDG01000000.gff

Feature definitions (for coding sequences and features in the gff file) were
assigned using Jim Kent's liftOver program with a blat alignment vs. the R64
(current) S288C reference sequence.

This assembly contains 12493 contigs (coverage: 5.96X, mean contig size: 683,
N50: 840). Using liftOver, 937 SGD gene features were found in the assembly.
